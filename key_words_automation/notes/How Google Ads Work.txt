How Google Ads Work?

- When I search for some product with Google I receive two types of results: Ad result and Organic result
1. Ad result means that someone pay to appear in first, second or third result.
2. Organic result means that Google thinks that is the most relevant website for what you are searching for.

The advertiser pays for every click he get in his website from Google.
For example: he pays 1$ for every click and after 50 clicks he gets a sale, lets supose his product costs 80$, then for every 50$ payed he has a ROAS of 30$.

The goal is to get as many conversions as possible by investing as little as possible in clicks per dollar.

Your Price = (the ad rank of the person below you) / (your quality score + $0.01)

What is Quality Score?
- Quality Score is defined by 3 aspects:
1. Landing Page Experience
 - How long are people staying on the page?
 - Are they scrolling?
 - Are they click on things?
2. Ad relevance
 - Are your website relevant for what people are looking for?
 - Have your ad the exact keyword that people are looking for?
3. Expected CTR (Click-Through Rate)
 - Are people clicking in your ads?
>>> Those metrics shows Google that people are actually finding what they're looking for. Google only makes money when people click on your ads

We also has the Ad Rank, we can calculate this with the following formula:
Ad Rank = Max BID * Quality Score

Obs: Max BID = Maximum cost-per-click offer limit          

Besides that, It's possible to add a negative keywords list, which means that the ad of the advertiser will not showned when a person types that keywords.
